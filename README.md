# Tumor diagnosis
This project is a part of my master thesis: https://diplomaterv.vik.bme.hu/hu/Theses/Biologiai-adatok-feldolgozasa-mely-tanulas/. This project combines classification and segmentation in a single project (brain_tumor_diagnosis.ipynb) and single network (brain_tumor_diagnosis_ynet.ipynb). The project shows examples downloading datasets, convert datasets, dataloaders, training and evaluation of the results. The jupyter notebook files contain more documentation for every code section.

# Dataset
Classification (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sartajbhuvaji/brain-tumor-classification-mri) and segmentation (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mateuszbuda/lgg-mri-segmentation) dataset are used in brain_tumor_diagnosis.ipynb file.

A dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashkhagan/figshare-brain-tumor-dataset) which contains classification and segmentation information is used in brain_tumor_diagnosis_ynet.ipynb file.

# Results
Final classification accuracy: 67.65%

Final average test dice loss: 0.0425
